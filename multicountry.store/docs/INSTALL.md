## Editing the Manifest.json

Once in the repository directory, it is time to edit the Minimum Boilerplate manifest.json file.

Once in are in the file, you must replace the vendor and account values. vendor is the account name you are working on and account is anything you want to name your theme. For example:

```sh
{
  "vendor": "storename",
  "name": "my-test-theme"
}
```

## Start

#### 1.Log in to VTEX account

```sh
vtex login
```

#### 2.Create a workspace

```sh
vtex use <workspacename>
```

#### 3.Run

```sh
vtex link --verbose
```

#### 4.Access the store through the workspace

```sh
vtex browse
```

## Workspaces

The workspaces are nothing more than what the namesake suggests. In VTEX IO, accounts have three main types of workspace, namely master, production and development.

Protected work environments that represent a copy very close to the one assembled in production, allowing the evolution of themes without affecting anything in the store.

*** There are three different types of workspaces: ***

Development workspace: an environment where it is possible to link, develop, install and publish applications. It is a workspace where you have more freedom in the settings you are going to make. It does not deal with traffic from production customers, cannot be promoted to master and cannot be used for A / B testing;

Production workspace: handles store traffic in production, can be used for A / B testing and can be promoted to the master workspace. Linking applications is not allowed;

Workspace Master: a unique production workspace in which its content reflects what is presented to the end user of the store.

#### Accessing your workspace

After creating the workspace, you can access it at this link: https: // {workspace} - {account} .myvtex.com, replacing {workspace} and {account} with the name of the previously created workspace and account. For example, https://devworkspace-appliancetheme.myvtex.com

#### See all workspaces

```sh
vtex workspace -ls
```

#### Conflict problems because you did other training, try to run the following command

```sh
vtex workspace reset
```

#### Creating a development workspace

https://devworkspace--appliancetheme.myvtex.com

```sh
vtex use nome-do-workspace
```

#### Creating a production workspace

```sh
vtex use {WorkspaceName} --production
```
